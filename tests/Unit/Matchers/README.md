**This group of tests added simply to verify all of the methods can be invoked.**

Functionality of the methods already tested by the PHPUnit itself so there is no need to cover all of the use-cases.
It's enough to test only "success" scenario to verify that method signature is correct and PHPUnit Assert method invoked with the right params.
